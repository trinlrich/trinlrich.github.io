            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
            <span class="und_text">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>

            As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: 
            <span class="red_text">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..." </span>
            And I felt him to be more fragile still. 
            <span class="und_text">I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
